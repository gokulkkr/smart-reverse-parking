# smart-reverse-parking
This project is a little demonstration of a smart reverse parking system that is used in cars. By using the Arduino, LEDs, and Ultrasonics sensor (HC-SR04) we can design this project. If the distance from the car and the obstacle (say wall) is less than 19 cm - Red LED will glow, else if the distance is greater than 20cm and less than 39cm - Blue LED will glow, else if the distance is greater than 40cm and less than 50cm - Green LED will glow.

Connections should be made as per the Circuit Diagram.
